REVAMPING COTTON:ON 
I am revamping the design of the company: Cotton On (a clothing brand ) website
which can cater to mobile and desktop usage.
Design Process
The design is for the customers who want to buy clothes from Cotton ON.I want to make the design more simpler, neat aesthetically pleasing and more easy to use. By redesigning a new website format myself. I would able to put myself in the customers shoes and make the website customer friendly. Additionally I think it may help to attract more customers.
I would like to be able to excess the navigation easily,have all the products in one page and nice website desgin
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
